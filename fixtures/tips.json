Change Air Filters</h3>\n<p>This is the most important maintenance task. A dirty filter restricts airflow, making your system work harder and use more energy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Standard filters: every 30-90 days</li>\n<li>High-efficiency filters: every 60-90 days</li>\n<li>With pets or allergies: every 30 days</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>2. Check Thermostat Settings</h3>\n<p>Ensure your programmable thermostat is set correctly for the season. A properly programmed thermostat can save 10-30% on heating and cooling costs.</p>\n\n<h2>Seasonal Maintenance</h2>\n<h3>Spring (Cooling Season Prep)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Clean outdoor condenser coils</li>\n<li>Clear debris from around outdoor unit</li>\n<li>Test system before hot weather arrives</li>\n<li>Check refrigerant levels</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Fall (Heating Season Prep)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Inspect heat exchanger</li>\n<li>Test furnace ignition system</li>\n<li>Lubricate blower motor</li>\n<li>Check carbon monoxide detectors</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Warning Signs to Watch For</h2>\n<p>Call a professional immediately if you notice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strange noises (grinding, squealing, banging)</li>\n<li>Weak airflow from vents</li>\n<li>Unusual odors</li>\n<li>System cycling on/off frequently</li>\n<li>Rising energy bills without explanation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Professional Maintenance</h2>\n<p>While DIY maintenance is important, professional service is essential. Schedule a tune-up twice per year - once in spring for AC and once in fall for heating.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What professionals check:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Electrical connections and voltage</li>\n<li>Refrigerant levels and leaks</li>\n<li>Condensate drain functionality</li>\n<li>System controls and safety devices</li>\n<li>Complete system performance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Regular HVAC maintenance is an investment that pays for itself many times over.

    "content": "<h2>Why Preventive Plumbing Maintenance Matters</h2>\n<p>Most plumbing emergencies are preventable with regular maintenance. A burst pipe or sewage backup can cause thousands in damage, but spending 30 minutes per month on preventive tasks can save you from disaster.</p>\n\n<h2>Monthly Plumbing Checklist</h2>\n<h3>1. Check for Leaks</h3>\n<p>Walk through your home monthly looking for signs of leaks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Water stains on ceilings or walls</li>\n<li>Dripping faucets or pipes</li>\n<li>Musty odors indicating hidden leaks</li>\n<li>Warped flooring or loose tiles</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>2. Test Water Pressure</h3>\n<p>Low water pressure can indicate hidden leaks or mineral buildup. High pressure can damage pipes and fixtures. Ideal pressure is 40-60 PSI.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Clean Drains</h3>\n<p>Pour boiling water down drains monthly to prevent buildup. For stubborn clogs, use a mixture of baking soda and vinegar followed by hot water.</p>\n\n<h2>Seasonal Tasks</h2>\n<h3>Winter Preparation</h3>\n<p>In Texas, we don't deal with freezing often, but when we do, it can be catastrophic:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Insulate exposed pipes in attics and crawl spaces</li>\n<li>Disconnect and drain garden hoses</li>\n<li>Install faucet covers on outdoor spigots</li>\n<li>Know where your main shutoff valve is</li>\n<li>During freezes: let faucets drip and open cabinet doors</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Annual Professional Inspections</h2>\n<p>Some tasks require professional expertise:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Water heater flush and inspection</li>\n<li>Sewer line camera inspection (every 2-3 years)</li>\n<li>Complete plumbing system evaluation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Emergency Prevention: Know Your Main Shutoff</h2>\n<p>Every family member should know where the main water shutoff valve is and how to turn it off. In an emergency, shutting off water quickly can mean the difference between minor and major damage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Test your shutoff valve annually</strong> to ensure it works. Valves that sit unused for years can seize up.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Plumbing emergencies are stressful and expensive, but most are preventable. By dedicating a small amount of time to preventive maintenance, you protect your home and your wallet.</p>",
